# OSSU
See the full OSSU CS curriculum [here](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).
This document is a collection of all the courses and certifications I've earned under the OSSU course.

## Summary (from the OSSU page)

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.,
but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

**Courses must**:
- Be open for enrollment
- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)
- Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles
- Match the curricular standards of the [CS 2013](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md): Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science
